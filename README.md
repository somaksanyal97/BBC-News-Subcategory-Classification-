# BBC-News-Subcategory-Classification-
BBC News subcategory classification for the HMLR Data Science Challenge using LLMs and LDA. Includes fine-grained topic modeling, transformer-based classification, named entity recognition with role tagging (e.g. politicians, musicians), and summarization of events related to April.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Given the BBC News dataset, the goals of this project are to:

- ðŸ”¹ **Break down broad categories** (e.g., `Business`, `Entertainment`, `Sport`) into more meaningful **subcategories** such as:
  - `Business` â†’ *stock market*, *company news*, *mergers and acquisitions*
  - `Entertainment` â†’ *cinema*, *theatre*, *music*, *literature*, *personalities*
  - `Sport` â†’ *cricket*, *football*, *Olympics*, etc.

- ðŸ”¹ **Extract named entities** from the text and identify their **roles** (e.g., `Politician`, `TV/Film Personality`, `Musician`).

- ðŸ”¹ **Summarize articles** that describe events which:
  - Took place in **April**
  - Were **scheduled** to occur in April
